## Main.py is the main runner file which has all the url rules and flask app initialization with all the url rules
## Views.py returns all the templates to the main.py to be displayed by creating a server.
## Util.py contains the pipeline program which starts with loading the image -> scaling the image -> Grayscaling the image -> Cropping the face -> turning the cropped image into Eigan images
-> Putting the eigan images into Machine learning model -> Predicting the images -> Showing the Output as the square around the face with the probablity of confidence.
